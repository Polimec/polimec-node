# Funding Pallet 

Polimec's main business logic. It allows users to create, evaluate, and fund projects.

It rewards project evaluators and contributors with `Contribution Tokens`. These tokens
can be redeemed for a project's native tokens, after their parachain is deployed on mainnet.

## Overview
The official logic for Polimec's blockchain can be found at our [whitepaper](https://polimec.link/whitepaper).

There are 3 types of users in Polimec:
- **Issuers**: They create projects and are responsible for their success.
- **Evaluators**: They evaluate projects and are rewarded for their work.
- **Contributors**: They contribute financially to projects and are rewarded on the basis of their contribution

A contributor, depending on their investor profile, can participate in different rounds of a project's funding.

There are 3 types of contributors:
- **Institutional**
- **Professional**
- **Retail**

Basic flow of a project's lifecycle:

| Evaluation Submissions    | Evaluators assess the project information, and if they think it is good enough to get funding, they bond Polimec's native token PLMC with [`bond_evaluation()`](Pallet::bond_evaluation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [`EvaluationRound`](ProjectStatus::EvaluationRound)                 |
| Evaluation End            | Evaluation round ends automatically after the [`Config::EvaluationDuration`] has passed. This is achieved by the [`on_initialize()`](Pallet::on_initialize) function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [`AuctionInitializePeriod`](ProjectStatus::AuctionInitializePeriod) |
| Auction Start             | Issuer starts the auction round within the [`Config::AuctionInitializePeriodDuration`], by calling the extrinsic [`start_auction()`](Pallet::start_auction)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [`AuctionRound(English)`](ProjectStatus::AuctionRound)              |

| Remainder Funding Start   | After the [`Config::CommunityFundingDuration`] has passed, the project is now open to token purchases from any user type                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [`RemainderRound`](ProjectStatus::RemainderRound)                   |
| Funding End               | If all tokens were sold, or after the [`Config::RemainderFundingDuration`] has passed, the project automatically ends, and it is calculated if it reached its desired funding or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [`FundingEnded`](ProjectStatus::FundingEnded)                       |
| Evaluator Rewards         | If the funding was successful, evaluators can claim their contribution token rewards with the [`TBD`]() extrinsic. If it failed, evaluators can either call the [`failed_evaluation_unbond_for()`](Pallet::failed_evaluation_unbond_for) extrinsic, or wait for the [`on_idle()`](Pallet::on_initialize) function, to return their funds                                                                    | [`FundingEnded`](ProjectStatus::FundingEnded)                       |
| Bidder Rewards            | If the funding was successful, bidders will call [`vested_contribution_token_bid_mint_for()`](Pallet::vested_contribution_token_bid_mint_for) to mint the contribution tokens they are owed, and [`vested_plmc_bid_unbond_for()`](Pallet::vested_plmc_bid_unbond_for) to unbond their PLMC, based on their current vesting schedule.                                                                        | [`FundingEnded`](ProjectStatus::FundingEnded)                       |
| Buyer Rewards             | If the funding was successful, users who bought tokens on the Community or Remainder round, can call [`vested_contribution_token_purchase_mint_for()`](Pallet::vested_contribution_token_purchase_mint_for) to mint the contribution tokens they are owed, and [`vested_plmc_purchase_unbond_for()`](Pallet::vested_plmc_purchase_unbond_for) to unbond their PLMC, based on their current vesting schedule | [`FundingEnded`](ProjectStatus::FundingEnded)                       |                                                                   |

## Interface
All users who wish to participate need to have a valid credential, given to them on the KILT parachain, by a KYC/AML provider.
### Extrinsics
* `create` : Creates a new project.
* `edit_metadata` : Submit a new Hash of the project metadata.
* `start_evaluation` : Start the Evaluation round of a project.
* `start_auction` : Start the English Auction round of a project.
* `bond_evaluation` : Bond PLMC on a project in the evaluation stage. A sort of "bet" that you think the project will be funded
* `failed_evaluation_unbond_for` : Unbond the PLMC bonded on a project's evaluation round for any user, if the project failed the evaluation.
* `bid` : Perform a bid during the English or Candle Auction Round.
* `contribute` : Buy contribution tokens if a project during the Community or Remainder round
* `vested_plmc_bid_unbond_for` : Unbond the PLMC bonded on a project's English or Candle Auction Round for any user, based on their vesting schedule.
* `vested_plmc_purchase_unbond_for` : Unbond the PLMC bonded on a project's Community or Remainder Round for any user, based on their vesting schedule.
* `vested_contribution_token_bid_mint_for` : Mint the contribution tokens for a user who participated in the English or Candle Auction Round, based on their vesting schedule.
* `vested_contribution_token_purchase_mint_for` : Mint the contribution tokens for a user who participated in the Community or Remainder Round, based on their vesting schedule.

### Storage Items
* `NextProjectId` : Increasing counter to get the next id to assign to a project.
* `NextBidId`: Increasing counter to get the next id to assign to a bid.
* `Nonce`: Increasing counter to be used in random number generation.
* `Images`: Map of the hash of some metadata to the user who owns it. Avoids storing the same image twice, and keeps track of ownership for a future project data access due to regulatory compliance.
* `Projects`: Map of the assigned id, to the main information of a project.
* `ProjectsIssuers`: Map of a project id, to its issuer account.
* `ProjectsInfo`: Map of a project id, to some additional information required for ensuring correctness of the protocol.
* `ProjectsToUpdate`: Map of a block number, to a vector of project ids. Used to keep track of projects that need to be updated in on_initialize.
* `AuctionsInfo`: Double map linking a project-user to the bids they made.
* `EvaluationBonds`: Double map linking a project-user to the PLMC they bonded in the evaluation round.
* `BiddingBonds`: Double map linking a project-user to the PLMC they bonded in the English or Candle Auction round.
* `ContributingBonds`: Double map linking a project-user to the PLMC they bonded in the Community or Remainder round.
* `Contributions`: Double map linking a project-user to the contribution tokens they bought in the Community or Remainder round.

## Usage
You can circumvent the extrinsics by calling the do_* functions that they call directly.
This is useful if you need to make use of this pallet's functionalities in a pallet of your own, and you don't want to pay the transaction fees twice.
### Example: A retail user buying tokens for a project in the community round
```rust
pub use pallet::*;

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests;

#[cfg(test)]
mod mock;

use pallet_funding::{self as funding};

#[frame_support::pallet(dev_mode)]
pub mod pallet {
    use super::*;
    use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
    use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;

    #[pallet::pallet]
    pub struct Pallet<T>(_);

    #[pallet::config]
    pub trait Config: frame_system::Config + funding::Config {}

    #[pallet::call]
    impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
        /// Buy tokens for a project in the community round if it achieved at least 500k USDT funding
        #[pallet::weight(0)]
        pub fn buy_if_popular(
            origin: OriginFor<T>,
            project_id: <T as funding::Config>::ProjectIdParameter,
            amount: <T as funding::Config>::CurrencyBalance
        ) -> DispatchResult {
            let retail_user = ensure_signed(origin)?;
            let project_id: <T as funding::Config>::ProjectIdentifier = project_id.into();
            // Check project is in the community round
            let project_info = funding::Pallet::<T>::project_info(project_id).ok_or(Error::<T>::ProjectNotFound)?;
            ensure!(project_info.project_status == funding::ProjectStatus::CommunityRound, "Project is not in the community round");

            // Calculate how much funding was done already
            let project_contributions: <T as funding::Config>::CurrencyBalance = funding::Contributions::<T>::iter_prefix_values(project_id)
                .flatten()
                .fold(
                    0u64.into(),
                    |total_tokens_bought, contribution| {
                        total_tokens_bought + contribution.contribution_amount
                    }
                );

            ensure!(project_contributions >= 500_000_0_000_000_000u64.into(), "Project did not achieve at least 500k USDT funding");

            // Buy tokens with the default multiplier
            <funding::Pallet<T>>::do_contribute(retail_user, project_id, amount, None)?;

            Ok(())
        }
    }

    #[pallet::error]
    pub enum Error<T> {
        ProjectNotFound,
    }
}
```

## Credentials
The pallet will only allow users with certain credential types, to execute certain extrinsics.:
