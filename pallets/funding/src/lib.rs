//! # Funding Pallet
//!
//! Polimec's main business logic. It allows users to create, evaluate, and fund projects.
//!
//! It rewards project evaluators and contributors with `Contribution Tokens`. These tokens
//! can be redeemed for a project's native tokens, after their parachain is deployed on mainnet.
//! ## üë∑ Work in progress üèóÔ∏è
//! Expect major changes between PRs
//!
//! ## Overview
//! The official logic for Polimec's blockchain can be found at our [whitepaper](https://polimec.link/whitepaper).
//!
//! There are 3 types of users in Polimec:
//! - **Issuers**: They create projects and are responsible for their success.
//! - **Evaluators**: They evaluate projects and are rewarded for their work.
//! - **Contributors**: They contribute financially to projects and are rewarded on the basis of their contribution
//!
//! A contributor, depending on their investor profile, can participate in different rounds of a project's funding.
//!
//! There are 3 types of contributors:
//! - **Institutional**
//! - **Professional**
//! - **Retail**
//!
//! Basic flow of a project's lifecycle:

//! | Bidder Rewards            | If the funding was successful, bidders will call [`vested_contribution_token_bid_mint_for()`](Pallet::vested_contribution_token_bid_mint_for) to mint the contribution tokens they are owed, and [`vested_plmc_bid_unbond_for()`](Pallet::vested_plmc_bid_unbond_for) to unbond their PLMC, based on their current vesting schedule.                                                                        | [`FundingEnded`](ProjectStatus::FundingEnded)                       |

//!
//! ## Interface
//! All users who wish to participate need to have a valid credential, given to them on the KILT parachain, by a KYC/AML provider.
//! ### Extrinsics
//! * [`create`](Pallet::create) : Creates a new project.
//! * [`edit_metadata`](Pallet::edit_metadata) : Submit a new Hash of the project metadata.
//! * [`start_evaluation`](Pallet::start_evaluation) : Start the Evaluation round of a project.
//! * [`start_auction`](Pallet::start_auction) : Start the English Auction round of a project.
//! * [`bond_evaluation`](Pallet::bond_evaluation) : Bond PLMC on a project in the evaluation stage. A sort of "bet" that you think the project will be funded
//! * [`failed_evaluation_unbond_for`](Pallet::failed_evaluation_unbond_for) : Unbond the PLMC bonded on a project's evaluation round for any user, if the project failed the evaluation.
//! * [`bid`](Pallet::bid) : Perform a bid during the English or Candle Auction Round.
//! * [`contribute`](Pallet::contribute) : Buy contribution tokens if a project during the Community or Remainder round
//! * [`vested_plmc_bid_unbond_for`](Pallet::vested_plmc_bid_unbond_for) : Unbond the PLMC bonded on a project's English or Candle Auction Round for any user, based on their vesting schedule.
//! * [`vested_plmc_purchase_unbond_for`](Pallet::vested_plmc_purchase_unbond_for) : Unbond the PLMC bonded on a project's Community or Remainder Round for any user, based on their vesting schedule.
//! * [`vested_contribution_token_bid_mint_for`](Pallet::vested_contribution_token_bid_mint_for) : Mint the contribution tokens for a user who participated in the English or Candle Auction Round, based on their vesting schedule.
//! * [`vested_contribution_token_purchase_mint_for`](Pallet::vested_contribution_token_purchase_mint_for) : Mint the contribution tokens for a user who participated in the Community or Remainder Round, based on their vesting schedule.
//!
//! ### Storage Items
//! * [`NextProjectId`] : Increasing counter to get the next id to assign to a project.
//! * [`NextBidId`]: Increasing counter to get the next id to assign to a bid.
//! * [`Nonce`]: Increasing counter to be used in random number generation.
//! * [`Images`]: Map of the hash of some metadata to the user who owns it. Avoids storing the same image twice, and keeps track of ownership for a future project data access due to regulatory compliance.
//! * [`Projects`]: Map of the assigned id, to the main information of a project.
//! * [`ProjectsIssuers`]: Map of a project id, to its issuer account.
//! * [`ProjectsInfo`]: Map of a project id, to some additional information required for ensuring correctness of the protocol.
//! * [`ProjectsToUpdate`]: Map of a block number, to a vector of project ids. Used to keep track of projects that need to be updated in on_initialize.
//! * [`AuctionsInfo`]: Double map linking a project-user to the bids they made.
//! * [`EvaluationBonds`]: Double map linking a project-user to the PLMC they bonded in the evaluation round.
//! * [`BiddingBonds`]: Double map linking a project-user to the PLMC they bonded in the English or Candle Auction round.
//! * [`ContributingBonds`]: Double map linking a project-user to the PLMC they bonded in the Community or Remainder round.
//! * [`Contributions`]: Double map linking a project-user to the contribution tokens they bought in the Community or Remainder round.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! You can circumvent the extrinsics by calling the do_* functions that they call directly.
//! This is useful if you need to make use of this pallet's functionalities in a pallet of your own, and you don't want to pay the transaction fees twice.
//! ### Example: A retail user buying tokens for a project in the community round
//! ```
//! pub use pallet::*;
//!
//! #[frame_support::pallet(dev_mode)]
//! pub mod pallet {
//! 	use super::*;
//! 	use frame_support::pallet_prelude::*;
//! 	use frame_system::pallet_prelude::*;
//!
//! 	#[pallet::pallet]
//! 	pub struct Pallet<T>(_);
//!
//! 	#[pallet::config]
//! 	pub trait Config: frame_system::Config + pallet_funding::Config {}
//!
//! 	#[pallet::call]
//! 	impl<T: Config> Pallet<T> {
//! 		/// Buy tokens for a project in the community round if it achieved at least 500k USDT funding
//! 		#[pallet::weight(0)]
//! 		pub fn buy_if_popular(
//! 			origin: OriginFor<T>,
//! 			project_id: <T as pallet_funding::Config>::ProjectIdParameter,
//! 			amount: <T as pallet_funding::Config>::CurrencyBalance
//! 		) -> DispatchResult {
//! 			let retail_user = ensure_signed(origin)?;
//! 			let project_id: <T as pallet_funding::Config>::ProjectIdentifier = project_id.into();
//! 			// Check project is in the community round
//! 			let project_info = pallet_funding::Pallet::<T>::project_info(project_id).ok_or(Error::<T>::ProjectNotFound)?;
//! 			ensure!(project_info.project_status == pallet_funding::ProjectStatus::CommunityRound, "Project is not in the community round");
//!
//! 			// Calculate how much funding was done already
//! 			let project_contributions: <T as pallet_funding::Config>::CurrencyBalance = pallet_funding::Contributions::<T>::iter_prefix_values(project_id)
//! 				.flatten()
//! 				.fold(
//! 					0u64.into(),
//! 					|total_tokens_bought, contribution| {
//! 						total_tokens_bought + contribution.contribution_amount
//! 					}
//! 				);
//!
//! 			ensure!(project_contributions >= 500_000_0_000_000_000u64.into(), "Project did not achieve at least 500k USDT funding");
//!
//! 			// Buy tokens with the default multiplier
//! 			<pallet_funding::Pallet<T>>::do_contribute(retail_user, project_id, amount, None)?;
//!
//! 			Ok(())
//! 		}
//! 	}
//!
//! 	#[pallet::error]
//! 	pub enum Error<T> {
//! 		ProjectNotFound,
//! 	}
//! }
//! ```
