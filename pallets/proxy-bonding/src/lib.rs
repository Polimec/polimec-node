//! # Proxy Bonding Pallet
//!
//! A FRAME pallet that facilitates token bonding operations with fee management capabilities. This pallet allows users to bond tokens from a configurable account (we call Treasury) while paying fees in various assets.
//! This pallet is intended to be used as an alternative to a direct bonding mechanism. In this way, the user does not need to own or hold the tokens, but can still participate in various activities by paying a fee.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Bonding Pallet provides functionality to:
//! - Bond treasury tokens on behalf of users
//! - Pay a bonding fee in different assets (e.g., DOT)
//! - Set the bond release to either immediate refund or time-locked release
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! ### Token Bonding
//! - Bond tokens from a treasury account into sub-accounts
//! - Support for existential deposit management
//! - Hold-based bonding mechanism using runtime-defined hold reasons
//!
//! ### Fee Management
//! - Accept fees in configurable assets (e.g., DOT)
//! - Calculate fees based on bond amount and current token prices
//! - Support both fee refunds and fee transfers to recipients
//! - Percentage-based fee calculation in USD terms
//!
//! ### Release Mechanisms
//! Two types of release mechanisms are supported:
//! - Immediate refund: Bonds can be immediately returned to treasury, and fees await refunding to users.
//! - Time-locked release: Bonds are locked until a specific block number, and fees can be sent to the configured fee recipient.
//!
//! ## Configuration
//! [`Config`](crate::pallet::Config)
//!
//! ### Example Configuration (Similar on how it's configured on the Polimec Runtime)
//!
//! ```rust
//! parameter_types! {
//! 	// Fee is defined as 1.5% of the USD Amount. Since fee is applied to the PLMC amount, and that is always 5 times
//! 	// less than the usd_amount (multiplier of 5), we multiply the 1.5 by 5 to get 7.5%
//! 	pub FeePercentage: Perbill = Perbill::from_rational(75u32, 1000u32);
//! 	pub FeeRecipient: AccountId =  AccountId::from(hex_literal::hex!("3ea952b5fa77f4c67698e79fe2d023a764a41aae409a83991b7a7bdd9b74ab56"));
//! 	pub RootId: PalletId = PalletId(*b"treasury");
//! }
//!
//! impl pallet_proxy_bonding::Config for Runtime {
//! 	type BondingToken = Balances; // The Balances pallet is used for the bonding token
//! 	type BondingTokenDecimals = ConstU8<10>; // The PLMC token has 10 decimals
//! 	type BondingTokenId = ConstU32<X>; // TODO: Replace with a proper number and explanation.
//! 	type FeePercentage = FeePercentage; // The fee kept by the treasury
//! 	type FeeRecipient = FeeRecipient; // THe account that receives the fee
//! 	type FeeToken = ForeignAssets; // The Asset pallet is used for the fee token
//! 	type Id = PalletId; // The ID type used for the ... account
//! 	type PriceProvider = OraclePriceProvider<AssetId, Price, Oracle>; // The Oracle pallet is used for the price provider
//! 	type RootId = TreasuryId; // The treasury account ID
//! 	type Treasury = TreasuryAccount; // The treasury account
//! 	type UsdDecimals = ConstU8<X>; // TODO: Replace with a proper number and explanation.
//! 	type RuntimeEvent = RuntimeEvent;
//! 	type RuntimeHoldReason = RuntimeHoldReason;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!
//! ## Extrinsics
//! [`transfer_bonds_back_to_treasury`](crate::pallet::Pallet::transfer_bonds_back_to_treasury)
//! [`transfer_fees_to_recipient`](crate::pallet::Pallet::transfer_fees_to_recipient)
//!
//! ## Public Functions
//! [`calculate_fee`](crate::pallet::Pallet::calculate_fee)
//! [`get_bonding_account`](crate::pallet::Pallet::get_bonding_account)
//! [`bond_on_behalf_of`](crate::pallet::Pallet::bond_on_behalf_of)
//! [`set_release_type`](crate::pallet::Pallet::set_release_type)
//! [`refund_fee`](crate::pallet::Pallet::refund_fee)
//!
//!
//! ### transfer_bonds_back_to_treasury
//! Transfer bonded tokens back to the treasury when release conditions are met.
//!
//! Parameters:
//! - `derivation_path`: The sub-account derivation path
//! - `hold_reason`: The reason for the hold
//! - `origin`: Signed origin
//!
//! ### transfer_fees_to_recipient
//! Transfer collected fees to the designated fee recipient.
//!
//! Parameters:
//! - `derivation_path`: The sub-account derivation path
//! - `hold_reason`: The reason for the hold
//! - `fee_asset`: The asset ID of the fee token
//! - `origin`: Signed origin
//!
//! ## Public Functions
//!
//! ### bond_on_behalf_of
//! Bonds tokens from the treasury into a sub-account on behalf of a user.
//!
//! Parameters:
//! - `derivation_path`: Sub-account derivation path
//! - `account`: Account ID of the user
//! - `bond_amount`: Amount of tokens to bond
//! - `fee_asset`: Asset ID of the fee token
//! - `hold_reason`: Reason for the hold
//!
//! ### calculate_fee
//! Calculates the fee amount in the specified fee asset based on the bond amount.
//!
//! ### refund_fee
//! Refunds the fee to the specified account.
//!
//! ## Events
//!
//! - `BondsTransferredBackToTreasury`: Emitted when bonds are transferred back to treasury
//! - `FeesTransferredToFeeRecipient`: Emitted when fees are transferred to the fee recipient
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! - `ReleaseTypeNotSet`: Release type not configured for the given derivation path/hold reason
//! - `TooEarlyToUnlock`: Attempted to unlock tokens before the configured release block
//! - `FeeToRecipientDisallowed`: Fee transfer to recipient not allowed for refunded release type
//! - `FeeRefundDisallowed`: Fee refund not allowed for locked release type
//! - `PriceNotAvailable`: Price information unavailable for fee calculation
//!
//! ## Example integration
//!
//! The Proxy Bonding Pallet work seamlessly with the Funding Pallet to handle OTM (One-Token-Model) participation modes in project funding. Here's how the integration works:
//!
//! ### Contribution Flow
//! 1. When a user contributes to a project using OTM mode:
//! - The Funding Pallet calls `bond_on_behalf_of` with:
//! - Project ID as the derivation path
//! - User's account
//! - PLMC bond amount
//! - Funding asset ID
//! - Participation hold reason
//!
//! 2. During project settlement phase:
//! - For successful projects:
//! - An OTM release type is set with a time-lock based on the multiplier
//! - Bonds remain locked until the vesting duration completes
//! - For failed projects:
//! - Release type is set to `Refunded`
//! - Allows immediate return of bonds to treasury
//! - Enables fee refunds to participants
//!
//! ### Key Interactions
//! ```rust
//! // In Funding Pallet
//! pub fn bond_plmc_with_mode(
//! 	who: &T::AccountId,
//! 	project_id: ProjectId,
//! 	amount: Balance,
//! 	mode: ParticipationMode,
//! 	asset: AcceptedFundingAsset,
//! ) -> DispatchResult {
//! 	match mode {
//! 		ParticipationMode::OTM => pallet_proxy_bonding::Pallet::<T>::bond_on_behalf_of(
//! 			project_id,
//! 			who.clone(),
//! 			amount,
//! 			asset.id(),
//! 			HoldReason::Participation.into(),
//! 		),
//! 		ParticipationMode::Classic(_) => // ... other handling
//! 	}
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Settlement Process
//! The settlement process determines the release conditions for bonded tokens:
//! - Success: Tokens remain locked with a time-based release schedule
//! - Failure: Tokens are marked for immediate return to treasury with fee refunds
